# Notes

- decrease the complexity of k th largest or k th smallest number at present I Can Implement in O(N\*logN)

- basic 10.cpp TODO Improve Shifting Negitive Numbers in One Side Not the T.C O(N) and S.C O(N) (i.e S.C O(1) goal)

- 6.cpp in intermediate TODO IMPLEMENT Duplicates in a array with better time complexity and space complexity
